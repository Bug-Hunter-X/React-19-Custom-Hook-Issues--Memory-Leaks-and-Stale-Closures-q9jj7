# React 19 Custom Hook Issues
This repository demonstrates potential issues with custom hooks in React 19, specifically focusing on memory leaks and stale closures when using the new `use` syntax with asynchronous operations and cleanup functions.

## Bug Description
Improperly handling asynchronous operations and cleanup functions within custom hooks can lead to unexpected behavior such as memory leaks and stale closures. This is amplified in React 19 with the new `use` syntax.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe the behavior of the buggy example and compare it to the corrected one.

## Solution
The solution focuses on properly implementing cleanup functions in custom hooks to address memory leaks and ensuring proper state management to avoid stale closures.  Specific fixes are included in `bugSolution.js`.

## Additional Notes
This repository serves as a learning tool to highlight potential pitfalls when working with custom hooks and asynchronous operations in React 19. Understanding these issues is crucial for building robust and efficient React applications.
