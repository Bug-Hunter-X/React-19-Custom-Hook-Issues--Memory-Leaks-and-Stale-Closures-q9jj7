In React 19, using the new `use` syntax with a custom hook might lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful with cleanup functions or asynchronous operations within the hook.  For example, forgetting to return a cleanup function in a `useAsync` custom hook can lead to memory leaks if the component unmounts while an asynchronous operation is still in progress.  Another issue could be improper handling of state updates within the hook, causing unexpected re-renders or stale closures.
